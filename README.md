# Seamless Lofi

Seamless lofi is a project that attempts to create endless lofi music using AI and other techniques. The music is never-ending, but constantly changing so the listener doesn't get tired by always hearing the same notes.

This is the dev branch. Check out the project website at https://raskitech.github.io/seamless-lofi
